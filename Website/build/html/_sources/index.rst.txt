Math Unikernel Documentation
============================

This is the documentation for our senior design math unikernel project. 
The purpose of this website is to provide a comprehensive guide for setting up the development environment, building the unikernel, 
and running it using our custom scripts. We also include links to the GitHub repository where you can find the source code and contribute to the project.
